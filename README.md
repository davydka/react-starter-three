### WebGL Explorations

This repo exists to explore various WebGL libraries, frameworks, and techniques.
A focus on mapping these proof-of-concepts (pocs) towards maintainable, testable code with real-world applicability towards digital products that are acccessible.

#### Questions to focus on:
* What can be built?
* How does this work with products?
* What is out there?
* How does this add to the experience?
* How do we add this to our skill-set?
    * How can this be tested?
    * Is this accessible?
